## Stub

This API interacts with internal HMRC services to fetch relevant data. For testing purposes, this API does not interact with the live version of these services but rather a fake _stub_. This _stub_ is a single service which simulates various responses for different request URLs and parameters. The _stub_ service can be found [here](https://github.com/hmrc/self-assessment-liability-stub).

## Testing

This API uses `sbt` to `clean`, `compile`, `test` and `run` the service.

### Unit testing

Unit tests can be run from the project root with the following command:
```console
sbt test
```

### API testing

With the [HMRC Service Manager](https://github.com/hmrc/sm2), this API can be further developed and tested by accessing the HMRC microservices required for this API to function. To test local changes to this repository:

1. Ensure a container runtime is active e.g. Colima:
```console
colima start
```
2. Start all microservices related to this API:
```console
sm2 --start SELF_ASSESSMENT_LIABILITY_API_ALL
```
3. Stop the version of this API which was started in the previous command:
```console
sm2 --stop SELF_ASSESSMENT_LIABILITY_API
```
4. Run the modified version of this API from the root directory:
```console
sbt run
```
Note: ensure that `sbt clean` and `sbt compile` commands are executed before `sbt run` every time changes are made to the API.

Requests can now be sent to this API, with responses matching any changes in the local code.
